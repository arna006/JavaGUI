# JavaGUI

 Tried making a GUI in JAVA!!!

This project is made for practice purposes, using a simple GUI application built with Java Swing. The main objective of this project is to allow the user to interact with a button in the interface. 

Each time the user clicks the button, the number of clicks is updated and shown on the screen.

---- The application uses a JButton for user interaction.

----- The JLabel displays the current number of button presses.

------ JFrame serves as the window of the application, while JPanel organizes the layout of the button and label.

The project implements ActionListener to handle button click events and update the click count dynamically.


Swing (javax.swing): Javaâ€™s built-in library for building GUI.
